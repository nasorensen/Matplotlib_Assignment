# Matplotlib_Assignment
UMN Matplotlib Assignment

This assignment was completed by me with some assistance from the Xpert Learning Assistant. I could not for the life of me figure out how to add titles -- I know the code was correct but I was getting an error stating I could not call a string for the title. I removed the attempts so that the code would run and look clean, but I will put an example of what I tried to add here in quotes. 
"plt.title('Number of Observed Mice vs Drug Regimen')"
